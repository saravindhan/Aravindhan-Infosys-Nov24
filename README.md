Title
FutureCart: AI-Driven Demand Prediction for Smarter Retail.

Project Statement:

In the realm of E-commerce, demand forecasting plays a pivotal role in ensuring business success. This project aims to develop a demand forecasting model in an E-commerce business that predicts future product demand leveraging time series analysis and multivariate regression based on historical sales data, along with Google Analytics KPIs such as Google clicks and Facebook impressions, which are valuable indicators of customer interest.

Outcomes

>Improved Inventory Management: More accurate demand forecasts lead to better inventory decisions, potentially reducing stock-outs and excess inventory.

>Enhanced Marketing Efficiency: Identify periods of high demand for targeted marketing campaigns, optimizing resource allocation.

>Data-Driven Decision Making: Reliable forecasts provide a basis for business decisions, such as pricing adjustments or product promotions.

>Accurate Demand Predictions: Implement a forecasting model that achieves high accuracy in predicting future demands, thereby improving customer service levels.

>Scalable Solution: Develop a solution that can scale to handle large datasets and varying demand patterns across multiple products.

Milestone 1: Week 1 
Module 1: Data Collec=on 
• Understand the problem statement 
• Gather sales data from relevant sources (database, store records) 
• Collect Google Analy5cs and Facebook Impressions data 




Milestone 1: Week 2 
Module 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing 
• Ensure your sales data is in a 5me series format (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) with 
5mestamps. 
• Clean and format data, handling missing values and outliers. Address them using 
appropriate techniques (imputa5on, elimina5on). 
• Plot the distribu5on plots on independent variables 
• Visualiza5ons to understand trends, seasonality, and correla5ons 
• Sta5s5cal summaries 



Milestone 2: Week 3 
Module 3: Time Series Modelling 
Sub Module 3.1: Model Selec=on 
• Within 5me series modelling, we’ll be exploring univariate models. 




Sub Module 3.2: Model FiMng 
• To iden5fy the op5mal model parameters. This involves trying different parameter 
combina5ons and selec5ng the one with the lowest error metric
